# Recommendation-MapReduce
Implementation of a MapReduce algorithm to efficiently perform posterior probability clustering for movie recommendations.

To prepare the data, put all 4 datafiles from https://www.kaggle.com/laowingkin/netflix-movie-recommendation/data in the data directory. Then run the file prepare_data.py, to have the datasets in a format ready for the algorithm, as well as a small subset of the data to perform initial computations on.
